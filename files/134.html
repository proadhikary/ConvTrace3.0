                <li class="list-group-item"><b>Reflections by the therapist:</b> The patient displayed significant anxiety regarding their work, particularly fears of making mistakes that could have serious consequences for their clients. Their reluctance to get out of bed and increased tardiness suggest a growing struggle with motivation and self-efficacy. The therapist demonstrated an attentive and empathetic approach, effectively reflecting the patient's emotions and concerns while guiding them through self-assessment. There seems to be a developing sense of rapport, as the patient is open about their feelings and acknowledges their stress levels. The therapist's use of scaling techniques appears to facilitate the patient's self-exploration, indicating receptiveness to therapy methods, although there is a clear expression of distress that may require ongoing support. Overall, the session reflected a collaborative environment where the patient feels safe to discuss their struggles, but the undertone of anxiety suggests ongoing work needed in building the patient's confidence and coping mechanisms. <br> Reflections on therapy interaction: <br>- Patient's high anxiety levels contribute to their reluctance to engage fully with work.<br>- The patient exhibits trust in the therapist by openly discussing their fears and stressors.<br>- Rapport appears to be fostering as the patient is comfortable sharing and rating their emotions.<br>- The use of scaling seems effective in allowing the patient to visualize their feelings and progress, indicating receptiveness to therapeutic techniques.<br>- Homework or action steps were not discussed in this session.<br> Overall Reflection: <br>The session highlighted the importance of addressing the patient's anxiety and feelings of inadequacy while continuing to build therapeutic trust and explore coping strategies.</li>

                <li class="list-group-item"><b>Action Plan:</b> Action Plan:<br>1. Cognitive Techniques:<br> - Identify and challenge anxious thoughts related to making mistakes at work. <br>2. Breathing Exercises:<br> - Practice deep breathing techniques to manage feelings of overwhelm and anxiety, especially when waking up and before starting the day.<br>3. Behavioral Activation:<br> - Develop a morning routine that encourages getting out of bed despite feelings of anxiety. This may include setting a specific time to wake up and establishing a reward for getting out of bed.<br>4. Scaling Feelings:<br> - Continue to scale anxiety levels (1-10) to monitor emotional states before and after work, which can help in recognizing patterns and triggers.<br>5. Journaling:<br> - Keep a journal of thoughts and feelings when experiencing anxiety, especially prior to going to work. This will aid in identifying specific triggers and understanding the connection between thoughts and emotions.<br>6. Homework Assignment:<br> - Create a list of potential positive outcomes or scenarios that could occur at work to counteract negative thoughts about making mistakes.<br>7. Follow-Up Discussion:<br> - In the next session, review the effectiveness of these techniques and discuss any progress made in managing anxiety and improving morning routines. <br>8.
