                <li class="list-group-item"><b>Reflections by the therapist:</b> The therapist observed that Jackie seemed somewhat guarded and ambivalent about her drinking habits. Her demeanor suggested reluctance, as she was only consenting to therapy to please her family rather than out of personal conviction. This indicates a lack of intrinsic motivation, which could affect her receptiveness to therapeutic techniques. Although Jackie was compliant with questions, her casual attitude towards her alcohol use might hinder deeper engagement in therapy. There seemed to be a limited rapport and trust, as she prioritized minimizing conflict with her family over addressing her own concerns, reflecting potential issues with transference. The therapist acknowledged and appreciated Jackie‚Äôs openness during the session, though her attitude towards attending future counseling sessions appears tentative and influenced by external expectations rather than genuine willingness. The initial exploration of her drinking seemed to reveal a dismissive attitude towards the potential consequences, which may require careful navigation in subsequent sessions. Overall, there may be challenges with homework assignments and commitment levels due to Jackie‚Äôs ambivalence and external motivations for participating in therapy.</li>
