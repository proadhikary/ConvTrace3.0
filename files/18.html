I worry about my health, about my job, about my family, about my finances, about the world. I worry about everything. Therapist: Do you have any thoughts of harming yourself or others? Patient: No, never. That's the one thing I'm not worried about. Therapist: Okay, that's good to hear. Do you think you might have an anxiety disorder? Patient: I don't know. I've never been diagnosed with anything before. Therapist: Well, let's do a screening for anxiety disorders. Do you get nervous when you have to speak in public? Patient: Yes, very nervous. Therapist: Do you get nervous when you have to take a test? Patient: Yes, very nervous. Therapist: Do you get nervous when you have to meet new people? Patient: Yes, very nervous. Therapist: Okay, you're answering yes to all of these questions. This tells me that you might have an anxiety disorder. I'm going to refer you to a specialist who can help you. Patient: Thank you.
