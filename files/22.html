The therapist noted Erica's emotional expression and physical posture as integral to her processing during the exercise. <br>There was a noticeable improvement in Erica's attitude towards her internal critic, which became less aggressive throughout the session, indicating progress in her self-acceptance and confidence in her career path decision. The conversation also highlights Erica's determination to accomplish her career goals without the guilt associated with societal expectations. <br>The therapist's encouragement for reflection before the next session indicates a focus on Erica's continued personal growth and the hope that she will maintain the clarity achieved during this interaction. The overall attitude towards homework, presented in the form of reflection, suggests an eagerness to encourage Erica's ongoing self-exploration outside of sessions. <br>In summary, the therapist perceives significant progress in Erica's internal dialogue and overall emotional well-being, framing the session as a turning point towards greater self-advocacy and peace with her choices.</li>
