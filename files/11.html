                <li class="list-group-item"><b>Reflections by the therapist:</b> The session revealed a significant level of frustration and distrust from the patient towards all therapists, whom they perceived as unhelpful and uniform in their approach. I noted the patient's intense demeanor and their repeated emphasis on feeling stuck and disillusioned with the therapeutic process. Their insistence that ‚Äúyou‚Äôre all the same‚Äù indicates a deep-seated skepticism that may point to previous negative experiences in therapy. <br>As the patient expressed their need for concrete guidance, they were visibly distressed, and it seemed that their "both guns blazing" attitude served as a defense mechanism to cope with their feelings of helplessness and anger. I observed that my responses triggered further exploration of their emotions, yet also highlighted a possible barrier: the intensity of their demands could be obstructing their receptiveness to the support I aimed to provide.<br>The rapport felt strained as the patient seemed to want immediate resolution without the exploration that often characterizes the therapeutic process. They appeared to be grappling with a sense of hopelessness, which was palpable when they articulated, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point?‚Äù This reflected a critical moment in therapy where I sensed a need to find a balance between validating their feelings and gently challenging them to consider new pathways forward.<br>Overall, I felt a strong commitment to helping the patient discover that middle ground they seek. Their acknowledgment of needing something indicates a willingness to engage further, though it will require careful navigation given their current mindset. I believe addressing this duality of extremes they feel caught between is essential for future sessions.</li>
