                <li class="list-group-item"><b>Reflections by the therapist:</b> The therapist's reflections after the session: <br>Carmelo displayed a significant surprise upon receiving his high anger score, indicating an initial disbelief in the seriousness of his anger issues. His reaction suggests a level of denial that may need to be explored further in future sessions. Despite his surprise, he also expressed an acute awareness of the consequences of his anger, demonstrating insight into how it affects his relationships and his life. This duality in his response shows a potential for growth, as he appears both resistant and receptive to the idea of addressing his anger.<br>The rapport between the therapist and Carmelo seems to be developing, as Carmelo engaged openly in the discussion about his feelings and experiences. The therapist's gentle probing for clarification appeared to foster this connection. Trust appears to be forming, evidenced by Carmelo‚Äôs willingness to share his vulnerabilities, particularly regarding his thoughts on violence and retaliation in his environment.<br>Carmelo‚Äôs acknowledgment of his anger and recognition of its implications indicates a degree of receptiveness to the therapeutic process. The therapist's method of presenting feedback as a tool for personal consideration likely contributed to creating a non-threatening atmosphere, encouraging Carmelo to engage with the material.<br>The discussion did not cover any specific homework or follow-up tasks, which may need to be introduced in future sessions to support Carmelo‚Äôs development and application of skills learned in therapy. Overall, there is a foundation for a productive therapeutic relationship, with opportunities for deepening insight and addressing core issues related to anger in subsequent sessions.</li>
