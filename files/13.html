The therapist exhibited a supportive demeanor, encouraging the client to express their emotions, which facilitated some acknowledgment of the client's anger. The rapport appears to be strained, as the client feels alone and dissatisfied with the therapy's effectiveness. However, the client also expressed relief in articulating their feelings, suggesting a degree of receptiveness to the conversation, albeit with underlying anxiety about expressing anger. This dynamic indicates potential transference where the client’s feelings of anger might reflect deeper issues beyond the immediate context of therapy. Overall, the therapist successfully created a space for the client to voice uncomfortable feelings, which is a positive step towards rebuilding trust and moving forward in the therapeutic process. <br>The therapist might reflect on the need to explore the client's feelings more deeply in future sessions, while also considering how to better engage the client to mitigate feelings of loneliness and frustration in therapy. Additionally, further discussion on the client's expectations and desired outcomes from therapy could help enhance receptiveness to therapeutic techniques and future homework assignments.</li>
